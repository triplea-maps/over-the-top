<h1>Map</h1>

<p>The map is separated into 6 sections
which include mainland Europe, the Western Front, North America, Africa and
various colonial territories, as well as 2 insets that reflect the USA and
Bolsheviks entering the war. The main portion of the map features the European
theatre of war which extends from Siberia and the Middle East, across N. Africa
and into the North Atlantic. The Western Front provides an in-depth tactical
representation of that region and can only accessed by land from the borders of
Germany and France; no amphibious landing points are provided for this inset.</p>

<p>The African theatre of operations reflect the European colonial territories and includes
Western India and Australia. The vast impassable Sahara Desert facilitates only
1 land access point on either side connecting N. Africa to the central and
southern regions of Africa. The African inset may be accessed by sea via the
West African coastline, the Suez Canal, or the Ottoman controlled port of
Basrah.</p>

<p>The North American inset features Western USA and Canada that are connected via sea-zones
to the North Atlantic providing access to the European theatre of operations.</p>

<p>Splitting the map across the center are the 'USA Path to War' and the 'Bolshevik Infiltration'
insets. They are not connected to each other but are accessible to North
America and Siberia respectively. These two insets represent the rising tide of
war fervor of the United States entering the Great War and the Bolshevik
Revolution gathering momentum. The US infantry unit crosses along the inset one
space per turn, simultaneously gaining economic value until it
"captures" the neutral mainland USA thus prompting their full
involvement into the war. The Bolshevik Infiltration inset represents the
Russian territories in the far east that have fallen to communist control. The
Bolshevik forces can build up strength within the inset and strike at 3 points
along Imperial Russia's eastern most territories thus opening another front.</p>

<h1>Rules</h1>
<ul>
<li>Base rules are <b>WW2V3</b></li>
<li><b>Low luck</b> is enabled by default</li>
<li>Two-hit units repair at the start of the next turn and only if certain "repairing" units are present</li>
<li>Producing fighters on carriers and producing new fighters on old carriers are both allowed</li>
<li>Partial amphibious retreat, air retreat, and submerging subs are all allowed</li>

<h2>How They Play</h2>

<p><img src="images/ger.png" />&nbsp;<b>Germans -</b> Imperial Germany is the leading faction
for the Central Powers and controls the overall tempo of the game. Germany has
many options at the start, but can really only focus on a single plan of
attack. Trying to fight everywhere at once will only lead to disaster. Deciding
which research and development option at the start is critical and should
complement the overall strategy. Moreover, it is best to purchase only a single
R&amp;D as the finances are stretched thin the first couple of rounds. The
Royal Navy poses a significant threat, and must be kept in check for as long as
possible. Winning a complete naval victory is highly unlikely, and if pursued
with too many resources will inevitably lead to loss of success on land.</p>

<p>As in WWII, the
Germans biggest enemy is time. The race to gain ground before the Americans can
pull its’ full might against the Central Powers is the essence of their
strategic struggle. Coordinating with the Austrians is essential, and if done
incorrectly can lead to an overall collapse of the Central Powers regardless of
how well Germany is performing. Germany’s greatest strength is the centralized
railroad system. It is highly fluid and can move large amounts of units quickly
to either front. Coordinating a steady stream of reinforcements via the
railroad is an art in and of itself. Striking at the Russians is the ideal
scenario. The Russians too have their race against time as the Bolsheviks will
inevitable gain strength overtime. Taking advantage of this situation is
Germany’s most logical play.</p>

<p><img src="images/iga.png" />&nbsp;<b>Imperial German Afrika -</b> Imperial German Afrika,
predecessors to the infamous Afrika Corps. In this game, which has taken many liberties in terms of authenticity,
provides the Central Powers with a formidable faction to match the Allied
colonial forces. Speed and mobility is key to winning as much territory and
income early on in order to sufficiently survive until Ottoman support is
provided. Strong as they are, they cannot carry on by themselves for long. They
are the thorn in the Allies’ side and if used correctly can tie up France and
England’s colonial support indefinitely.</p>

<p><img src="images/aus.png" />&nbsp;<b>Austrians -</b> The Austro-Hungarian
Empire, like a fettered corpse dragged along by the strong arm of Germany is
the weakest of the Central Powers. R&amp;D is costly as it will eat a giant
chunk from their low income. Therefore, it is best to purchase one at the start
(if at all) and focus for the remainder of the game on low cost ground units.
Naval strength is weak, and is primarily in place to support Ottoman fleet
operations in the Mediterranean. Keeping Italy in check defensively is
certainly achievable, however Germany is required for any long-term offensive
strikes. Austria is in a precarious position and can either become Germany’s
greatest asset or their greatest burden.</p>

<p><img src="images/ott.png" />&nbsp;<b>Ottomans -</b> The Ottoman Empire aka &quot;sick man of Europe&quot;. The primary
goal for the Ottoman Empire is to gain control of Gallipoli, securing the Black
Sea as well as capturing the Suez Canal from the British. Cairo is the gateway
to Africa. As long as Egypt remains in British hands, the German forces in
Africa will remain cut off and are left to fend for themselves. Fighting the
Russians on their vulnerable southern front is an ideal way to syphon their
resources away from the Eastern Front. Ottoman naval power if used wisely, can create
multiple offensive options against Allied forces in the Mediterranean and may
prove crucial to ensuring Italy’s downfall.</p>

<p><img src="images/fre.png" />&nbsp;<b>French -</b> France, L'avance, l'avance,
toujours l'avance! France is very much a one dimensional
faction. Gaining ground on the Western Front and forcing the Germans to retreat
towards the interior is their primary purpose. Their supporting elements can be
used to bolster the Royal Navy in the channel as well as securing Italy’s northern
front. They have the benefit of a well placed and lucrative railway system.
They are also economically sound and able to focus on R&amp;D. As they are tied
to their colonial counterpart, they can provide valuable technological upgrades
to help turn the tide against Imperial German Afrika.</span></p>

<p><img src="images/fca.png" />&nbsp;<b>French Colonial Africa -</b> French Colonial Africa, the French Foreign
Legion on steroids. As with the Germans, the French have been provided with a
formidable military presence in Africa. Because of their strategic location
along the western coast, they have the advantage of security through distance.
Coordinating with British colonial forces efficiently by way of ‘leap frogging’
attacks against the Germans is the surest way to victory and the conquest of
the continent.</p>

<p><img src="images/rus.png" />&nbsp;<b>Russians -</b> The Russian Empire, the bear caught
between a giant vise. Their survival solely depends on Germany’s offensive
decision. If the East is Germany’s main focus, then it will only be a matter of
time till the czarist forces are inevitably driven back to the gates of Moscow,
there to await their fate. The Russians must learn how to choose their battles
wisely; giving up ground where they can and holding on to their most vital
territories at all cost. The railways are the key to plugging the holes around
their territorial perimeter. Research and development is highly discouraged as
it will only allow the Bolsheviks to gain access to the same technological
upgrades. Making the enemy pay dearly for every inch of sacred soil is Russia’s
sworn oath.</p>

<p><img src="images/bri.png" />&nbsp;<b>British -</b> Great Britain, will continue to rule the waves as ever before. Naval power and
complete dominance of the Atlantic is what they built for. Their first priority
is to rid their waters of the U-boat menace and then to challenge the Imperial
German Navy into a final showdown. Once the German fleet is destroyed, the
British can strike at the heartland of Germany by way of amphibious assaults.
Supporting the French on the Western Front with a steady stream of forces
ferried from across the channel is their second priority. Without British
ground support in France, the Germans can easily overrun Allied Forces along
the Somme in a flanking maneuver. Researching technological upgrades will
benefit their Commonwealth’s interest more so than their own, so purchase them
accordingly.</p>

<p><img src="images/bc.png" />&nbsp;<b>British Commonwealth -</b> The British Commonwealth, the "Empire
Down Under". Holding Cairo at all cost is the key to victory in the southern hemisphere.
The British Commonwealth control the gateway in and out of Africa. If it is
lost, the Ottomans will spill into Africa and aid the Germans in their conquest
of the continent. Their main focus should be to secure naval superiority in the
Indian Ocean so that offensive strikes can be brought to bear against the
Ottomans in the Middle East and the Germans in East Africa. British R&amp;D can
certainly give them an edge they so desperately need against the enemy.</p>

<p><img src="images/ita.png" />&nbsp;<b>Italians -</b> Italy, "O Solo Mio"! Like their French
neighbors, they too are a one dimensional faction. Their entire focus should be
to break through the Austrian forces in the Alps and force the Germans to
re-route vital forces to aid their allies. R&amp;D is strongly discouraged as
their funds are stretched thin. French reinforcements are absolutely essential
to halt an Austro-German offensive.</p>

<p><img src="images/ame.png" />&nbsp;<b>Americans -</b> The United State, a.k.a "Murica". The
Americans have a small lending hand towards the Allies at the very start of the
game via a small expeditionary force on the Western Front. Not sufficiently
sized enough to mount their own offensive but may prove very useful towards
exploiting gaps in the German lines. America’s entry into to war is fixed on
the 6<sup>th</sup> turn when the infantryman completes its long journey towards
"capturing" the hearts and minds of the American war effort. However they
choose to complete their first initial "big purchase" depends on how things
have played out until then. They are complimented with a sufficient
transport fleet (if properly defended by the Royal Navy) to send the first
batch of ground forces to the European theatre. Let their arrival not be too
late!</p>

<p><img src="images/bol.png" />&nbsp;<b>Bolsheviks -</b> The Bolsheviks, "workers of the world
unite"! The Bolsheviks are placed in their own separate faction category. They
are at war with the Allies, but at the same time on un-friendly terms with the
Central Powers. If AI controlled, the Bolsheviks will act as a wild card.
Naturally they will fight the Russians but they cannot be counted on for
coordination efforts with the Human player controlled Germans. On the other
hand, if the Bolsheviks are human controlled, then they can be strategically coordinated
by the Central Powers players to bring a quick victory in East. The drawback is
that though the Bolsheviks are fighting a common enemy (The Allies), they
cannot gain access to Central Powers’ territory. In other words, their movement
and conquering ability is restricted to territories captured from the Allies,
hence they cannot travel via Central Power’s boundaries.</p>

<h1 style="border-bottom:solid #AA610D 1.5pt;">Turn Sequence</h1>

<h2>Purchase Phase</h2>

<p>This phase is for purchasing units as well as technological upgrades which are then
placed at the end of the round. To research a new technology, simply purchase
the ‘develop-unit’ icon and then place it in a factory upon the placement
phase. Access to researched units will occur at the start of the following
round. The exception to this is for the Colonial Factions; they will be able to
benefit from the researched technology given to them by the ‘Mother Country’
the very same round as they are followed immediately afterwards in the order of
play.</p>

<h2>Combat Move 1</h2>

<p>This phase is primarily reserved for moving battleships,
battlecruisers and railguns into position to fire their munitions. All units
moved during this round will be permanent and must committed to the battle to
which they are engaged, no retreat will be allowed. The exception to this is if
additional units are moved into the same territory during the second Combat
Move phase. This will in turn unlock the ability to retreat the entire force as
a whole.</p>

<h2>Combat Move 2</h2>

<p>This combat move phase is for all other units to be
moved to adjacent territories to engage in combat. Upon the start of this phase
any and all ‘munition carrying units’ will spawn their shells in the territory
to which they were initially moved. The player may then move those shells and
disperse them to other adjacent territories to support attacks or conduct
bombarding operations. If the shells are left in the territory in which they
were spawned, then they will automatically be engaged towards any enemy units
within that territory.</p>

<h2>Non-Combat Move</h2>

<p>This phase provides the player with the ability to
move all units that have not been previously engaged in combat, with the
exception of aircraft that require a friendly territory to land. Trains may not
pass through territories that were captured during the combat phase and must
wait till the following round to gain access.</p>

<h2>Placement Phase</h2>

<p>This phase allows the player to place their purchased units or R&amp;D into any owned
territory containing a factory, with the exception of enemy territories
containing a factory that was captured that turn. Naval forces require both a
shipyard and a factory in order to be placed into the adjacent seazone.
Trenches do not require a factory and may be placed in any territory owned at
the beginning of the turn.</p>

			hitpoints) unit always on the map for each faction so that you can re-add the correct number of trenches
			to your battle simulation. Unfortunately, certain scenarios can't be perfectly simulated (for example, a
			territory with a damaged trenches and two undamaged trenches).

			Munitions are shells that can be shot from heavy artillery, battleships,
			battlecruisers, and railguns. They are a 1-use attack element that engages in
			the beginning of a combat phase and can be used to strike at any land forces, ships,
			or production facilities in range. They are "loaded" during the first combat phase and can be
			"fired" during the second combat phase (and moved independently from the unit that fired them).

			<b>Munitions</b><br/>

		</td>
		<td>
			Gas shells can be shot from heavy artillery only and are used to as a first-strike
			element towards infantry/cavalry units. They bypass enemy trenches and directly engage soft targets
			in the territory. Unlike munitions, they have no movement and so heavy artillery must be committed to
			the battle for their gas shells to have an effect.

			As the leader of the Bolshevik revolution, Lenin spreads his communist philosophies wherever he goes. 
			Each turn, he recruits a new infantry to the cause and, while lacking any attack or defense himself, he 
			inspires up to 10 infantry with +1 support.
